# 🌀 API Mashup — App Wing Event

## 📌 What is API Mashup?

API Mashup is an App Wing event where you build something *unforgettable*.

You'll be given a fixed set of quirky, completely unrelated APIs and exactly **2.5 hours** to combine them into one single-screen mobile app (Android or iOS) that is creative, hilarious, and surprisingly functional.

The twist? The APIs don't go together. That's the point. Your job is to make them feel like they were *meant* to be together.

## 🎯 The Challenge

* Build a **single-screen mobile app** (Android or iOS) in **2.5 hours**
* Integrate **3–4 APIs** from the provided list
* Display their data together in a **creative or entertaining way**
* The combo should feel clever, not forced

## 🏆 Judging Criteria

| Criterion | What we're looking for |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Creativity** | How originally and imaginatively are the APIs used? |
| **Number of Features** | How many meaningful interactions and features did you build? |
| **Cohesion** | Do the APIs feel naturally connected, or does it feel like a forced mashup? |
| **Code Quality** | Clean, structured code — use of loggers, a repository pattern, smart list updates, a dedicated API client, etc. |

### 💡 Bonus Points for:
* Using a **Repository pattern** to centralize all API calls (no cluttered `Activity.kt` or `ViewController.swift`)
* **DiffUtil** (Android) or **DiffableDataSource / Native SwiftUI Lists** (iOS) for smooth list updates
* Proper **logging** throughout the app
* **Error handling** and elegant loading states
* Smooth and polished UI despite the chaos
